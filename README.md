# Zomato_Restaurant_Clustering_and_Sentiment_Analysis
This project used advanced data analytics techniques to gain a deeper understanding of restaurants and customer feedback on the popular online meal delivery platform, Zomato.
This project aims to analyze Zomato customer reviews and ratings for Hyderabad restaurants and provide insights into underlying trends, cost-benefit trade-offs, and customer sentiments. The project includes the following steps:

1. Basic EDA for restaurant data and ratings:
This step examines the data set to understand the distribution of ratings, reviews, dishes, costs, collections, and other characteristics of restaurants. This step also includes cleaning and pre-processing the data for further analysis.

2. Visualization with different charts:
In this step, various charts and graphs are created to visualize the data and identify the patterns and relationships between the characteristics. Some of the charts that can be used are bar charts, pie charts, boxplots, scatter plots, heat maps, etc.

3. Hypothesis Testing:
In this step, some hypotheses or assumptions about the data are tested using statistical methods. For example, it tests whether the average rating of a restaurant is different from a certain value or whether the cost of a restaurant is related to its rating or the type of cuisine.

4. Feature technique for clustering and sentiment analysis:
In this step, new features are created or existing features are transformed to be suitable for clustering and sentiment analysis. For example: scaling numerical features, extracting keywords or themes from ratings, etc.

5. Clustering analysis using k-means and agglomerative:
In this step, k-means and agglomerative clustering algorithms are applied to group the restaurants based on their cost and rating performance. This step can help identify the optimal segments of restaurants that provide high or low value to customers.

6. Sentiment analysis of ratings:
In this step, sentiment analysis techniques are applied to classify the reviews into positive, negative and neutral sentiments. This step can help understand customer feedback and satisfaction with restaurants.

The project can help restaurants improve their service quality, menu offerings, and customer satisfaction based on customer feedback.
